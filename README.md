Real-Time Vision-Based Desired Object Grasping When Multiple Objects Are Present

• Detect different kinds of objects when multiple objects (5 to 10) are present within the focus of the webcam.
• Classify the objects with a confidence score of more than 50 using YOLOv3.
• Display the suitable grasping points(2 or 4 fingers) for the desired object and a bounding box using CNN.
• Utilised: YOLO Algorithms, Python
